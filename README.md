# IAT-267-Solace-Living

Porject Concept:
SolaceLiving is an idea that tackles a small, simple every-day situation of stumbling into a dark and cold residence, tired and stressed, in hopes of changing the experience of residents entering home from a long day of work or school. The concept of this work is to address young students and graduates fresh into the early stages of their careers, who often live alone in dorms and apartment buildings, with no sense of belonging or comfort within their accommodations. SolaceLiving is a system that evokes a sense of warmth and welcome upon entry through the doorway, being greeted with lights that turn on automatically, ambient music of choice, and a floor that heats up immediately upon the return of its owner.

Project Overview:
This assignment was created with Processing, Arduino, various electrical circuit components, and many sensors. The model is designed to emulate a unique one-room apartment with a loft and ceiling windows that are openly exposed to the sky.

Project Collaboration:
This project is the collaborative work of Simon Fraser University students Andy Guan, David Dai, Frank Wen, and Wesley Liu, created for the course "Introduction to Technological Systems" under the School of Interactive Arts and Technology.

My Role:
As the only programmer in the team, I did all the programming for both Arduino and Processing, and I also assisted Andy to build the circuit.
