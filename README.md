# IAT-267-Solace-Living

The project was made by Andy Guan, David Dai, Frank Wen, Wesley Liu

Porject Concept:
This apparatus provides comfort and a feeling of grandeur for residents through automated lights and heated floors to welcome them home. This saves the trouble of fiddling in the dark and provides an escape from mundane tasks for weary workers and students at the end of a stressful day. Solace living was created with young prospective individuals living alone in small housing environments in mind, to enhance their living quality and provide a relaxing space.

As the only programmer in the team, I did most of the programming for both Arduino and Processing, and I also assisted Andy to build the circuit. Andy, Wesley, and Frank are all accommodating, and they also contribute to the code and the design of the interface. Additionally, I also wrote a small portion of the document.
