# IAT-267-Solace-Living

The project was made by Andy Guan, David Dai, Frank Wen, Wesley Liu

Porject Concept:
This apparatus provides comfort and a feeling of grandeur for residents through automated lights and heated floors to welcome them home. This saves the trouble of fiddling in the dark and provides an escape from mundane tasks for weary workers and students at the end of a stressful day. Solace living was created with young prospective individuals living alone in small housing environments in mind, to enhance their living quality and provide a relaxing space.

Andy Guan:
I did most of the circuit, research on how to connect the mosfet, and how to power the heating pad externally. I also drew the schematic with the help of my other teammates. I helped build the house, but not design the house. I wrote most of the report. My other teammates were helpful and available for extra help.

Jianghui Dai:
I did most of the programming for both Arduino and Processing, and I also assisted Andy to build the circuit. Andy, Wesley, and Frank are all accommodating, and they also contribute to the code and the design of the interface. Additionally, I also wrote a small portion of the document.

Frank Wen:
I did most of the presentation slides with the help of Wesley, who drew the pictures. I helped with building the circuit and gave ideas towards the coding portions and helped solve problems. I built the house with the help of Wesley and Andy, and gave ideas of what we could do for the whole project. My teammates were helpful and responsible for each individualâ€™s role.

Wesley Liu:
Throughout the term, I worked on sketches and designs for all our previous and current concepts. The design of the final model and most of its cut, build, and finish was supplied by me. I provided advice and guidance on document and slide layouts, interface design and art-direction, and ideas during our project reworking. I edit and rewrite all content, play a large part in testing, and also have a hand in debugging. My teammates have particularly strong skills in coding and circuitry, and were dedicated and focused in achieving a high level of quality in this project for the most part. Opinions, rebuttals, and critiques were openly received and responded to, and good attitudes in communication about problems and solutions was evident in each team member.
